      <span class="horror-text">Caution:</span> You have descended into Level 2 of the Backrooms. Level 2 is the third and last level in the back room where you can use it as your departure point.

      <h5>The first known image of Level 2.</h5>
    </div>
    <p>Level 2 is mainly composed of dark black and gray concrete maintenance tunnels, stretching for millions of miles. The walls at this level are covered with pipes, and occasionally ventilation ducts can be seen. These pipes usually contain some black viscous liquid flowing through them. Sometimes some doors can be found, but most of them are locked or lead to a dead end. They usually have shelves containing random items inside, mostly computers.</p>
    <p>In certain areas of the Level 2 corridor, temperatures may be unbearable, reaching up to 43 degrees Celsius (110 degrees Fahrenheit) or even higher. This usually occurs in areas with the highest machine noise, such as the end of corridors.</p>
    <p>The entities that appear in this hierarchy are the most dangerous in the rear compartment. The noise that occurs in ventilation ducts is usually caused by crawling bacteria. You can also find Mark in the employee bathroom at Level 2. Other entities at this level include Laughing Nightmare, Young Faceless Spirit, Limb Group, Hound, Male Death Moth, Sad Corpse, Acid Blaster, and Skin Thief. The only thing you need to remember is to run away immediately when you see any entity. The entity shown in the above image has not yet been confirmed, and the fate of the photographer of this photo is also unclear.</p>
    <h3>Bases, outposts, and communities</h3>
    <h4>Survivors</h4>
    <p>A hierarchical exploration group consisting of 29 people, led by Austin. They are a friendly and willing to trade group. They loaded their supplies in wooden boxes discovered from Level 1. They were also the first group to discover the sad corpse. This group often clashed with an outpost of believers named Jerry.</p>
    <h4>Office area EL3A</h4>
    <p>The office area EL3A is a Level 2 office area where 30 members of B.N.T.G. (Non Aligned Trade Group) reside.
        For more information, please refer to the office area EL3A</p>

    <h3>Entrance and Exit</h3>
    <h4>Entrance</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="horror-text">Warning:</span>
        <p>Level 2 is one of the few levels in the back room that can be directly accessed from the real world. You can enter Level 2 by exploring a sufficiently long distance in <a href="level-001.html">Level 1</a>. It can also enter from the hub.</p>
    </p>
    <h4>Exit</h4>
    <p>
      <span class="horror-text">Entering Level 1:</span>
      <p>Contrary to most people's beliefs, not all doors appearing in Level 2 are locked or lead to dead ends. Some can enter Level 3, Level 4, and occasionally return to Level 1. Finding an unlocked door with a comically painted colorful exterior will take you to <a href="level-283.html">Level 283(Not open)</a>. If you cut in an extremely hot area at Level 2, you may be trapped at <a href="level-002_1.html">Level 2.1(Not open)</a>.</p>
