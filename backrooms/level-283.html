      <span class="horror-text">Caution:</span>
      <p>Level 283 is a huge and complex maze park discovered by B.N.T.G. on December 14, 2016. B. N.T.G.'s caravan "Ten Thousand Acres of Gold" encountered an unfamiliar square blue wheat field while crossing Level 10, which was also confirmed to be the first entrance known by M.E.G. and B.N.T.G. to Level 283.</p>
    </p>

      <h5>One of the entrances to the pipeline from B.N.T.G.'s "White Fort".</h5>
    </div>
    <p>The huge structure of Level 283 is composed of a large number of different types of indoor amusement parks. In Level 283, there are small spiral pipes with claustrophobia, a maze composed of metal mesh platforms covered with rubber pads, a huge fortress that extends up a full 50 feet (approximately 15.24 meters) high, and an ocean ball pool that is difficult to measure in depth and appears to have no end. The main resources found in Level 283 are food and beverages in the rest area.</p>
    <p>Many entities, such as hunting dogs, laughing nightmares, skin thieves, mournful corpses, limb groups, and young or adult faceless spirits, all appear within Level 283. It is worth noting that the performance of the Faceless Spirit at this level is quite abnormal. Young faceless spirits will only show their cruelty and malice without the supervision of adult faceless spirits. Otherwise, they will change their normal behavior and attempt to be polite to wanderers. Adult faceless spirits usually sit next to the dining tables and chairs at Level 283, which is the resting area; However, there are also a few adult faceless spirits discovered by wanderers in mazes and fortresses. When a young faceless spirit is physically attacked by a wanderer or an entity, adult faceless spirits within a certain range around it will immediately protect the young faceless spirit and show strong hatred towards the attacker.</p>
    <p>There is also an entity that only appears at this level in Level 283, namely the carnival clowns. As its name suggests, these entities wear the clothing of clowns and exhibit extremely exaggerated behavior. Evidence suggests that different carnival clowns have different physical and psychological characteristics, so it is necessary to classify carnival clowns in more detail.</p>
    <h3 style="color:red;">Piping</h3>
    <p>There are a large number of pipes in Level 283, which usually have circular entrances, and wanderers can choose to crawl in. The entrance to the pipeline can usually be found in fortresses and rest areas. The diameter of the pipeline ranges from 3 feet (approximately 91.4 centimeters) to 5 feet (approximately 152.4 centimeters), and there are often intersections or climbing sections that guide homeless people to move vertically. The windows inside the pipeline are all blurry and emit faint light, which is the natural light source inside the pipeline. There are rumors that there are windows in Level 283, but so far it has not been confirmed. At the end of the pipeline is a spiral pipeline slide that leads to the rest area, maze, and ocean pool. Although there are only a small number of entities within Level 283, it is difficult to escape if attacked in the narrow space within the pipeline. Xiaoyan is the most common entity in the pipeline area of Level 283, and the long and poorly lit pipeline here has a great attraction for them.</p>
    <h3 style="color:red;">Ocean ball pool</h3>
    <p>There are almost countless ocean balls in the seemingly endless ocean ball pool. The area of Level 283 is shrouded in a layer of fog, making it difficult for wanderers entering the ocean pool to see a view 50 feet away. In theory, wanderers can rely on special equipment obtained from other levels to cross this area, but these ocean balls exhibit a quicksand like nature: the more they move in it, the deeper they sink. There was once a wanderer who went deep into the ocean ball pool to a point where he couldn't bear the weight of the ocean ball above his head, and inevitably fell down without a trace. Limb groups are the only entities with activity records in the area of Level 283, and it is recommended to treat them with caution. The exit of the ocean ball pool is still unknown, but we recommend that any wanderer who reaches its entrance return the same way: as long as they exert enough force, they can climb back into the pipeline through the spiral slide at the exit of the pipeline.</p>

        <h5>The maze corridor on the way from "White Castle" to Epsilon Base.</h5>
    </div>
    <h3 style="color:red;">Rest area</h3>
    <p>Both the appropriate protection provided by adult faceless spirits and the abundant resources present within them indicate that the rest area is the most friendly area in Level 283. Benches and dining tables and chairs can be seen everywhere in the rest area, with a pile of hamburgers placed on each one, and the type of hamburger is marked on the packaging bag of the burger. In the center of some tables, there are piles of French fries on the plates, some of which are sprinkled with melted cheese and bacon crumbs. There are also fountains in the rest area that can spray drinks, usually with plastic cups and plastic foam bowls. If you shift your gaze away from the hamburgers and french fries, they will be filled when you look back. Adult faceless spirits will sit on some benches and dining chairs. The entrance and exit of the rest area are connected to pipelines, mazes, and fortresses.</p>
    <p>There is a special lounge in the lounge that leads to the best party in the entire back room.</p>
    <p>B.N.T.G.'s 283 resource extraction station "White Fort" is located in one of the many rest areas and is guarded by adult faceless spirits and armed guards. Its main task is to transport a large number of hamburgers and French fries to other B.N.T.G. bases, campsites, and allied forces within the area. The extraction station extends into the maze and establishes a living area there.</p>
    <h3 style="color:red;">Labyrinth</h3>
    <p>The maze is an intricate corridor built by barbed wire fences and covered with rubber pads, and its edges are wrapped with colored foam rubber. In the maze, wanderers can find a large number of children's amusement facilities, such as seesaw, swing, carousel, jumping board 1, small slide, monkey rack 2, and swing group 3. Part of the walls inside the maze are made of hard plastic and decorated in a strange and comical style, with disproportionate doors and windows. However, as discussed in the pipeline section, no windows have been found within Level 283. The carnival clowns have the highest probability of appearing in the maze, and they are often surrounded by young faceless spirits. You can directly reach the maze by sliding down the pipeline, or you can also pass through a strangely shaped and colorful door in the lounge. The city gate leading to the fortress can be found in the maze. In certain parts of the maze, the corridor will suddenly come to an end, revealing endless colorful plastic balls, known as the ocean ball pool.</p>
    <p>Someone once witnessed a porcelain clown doll in a maze, with a hissing purple liquid emanating from the corners of its mouth, smelling like a bucket of grape flavored soda in a colorful plastic container. This liquid has been recorded as a hazardous substance with extremely strong acidity.</p>
    <p>B. N.T.G.'s 283 resource extraction station "Baibao" has set up its living area within a maze.</p>
    <p>There is a special maze in Level 283, referred to as the "square" by the unfriendly and enthusiastic singing revelry clowns, which is the habitat for all the revelry clowns in the back room. M. The E.G. staff have not yet discovered the true location of the 'square', and the revelry clowns have refused to provide them with relevant information, only claiming that they were born and raised in the 'square'.</p>
    <h3 style="color:red;">Fortress</h3>
    <p>Fortresses are huge buildings that can reach a height of 50 feet (approximately 15.24 meters). The fortress is stacked with many comically styled colorful rooms, each of which is illuminated by a quirky colorful light bulb. The entrances and exits of the fortress are huge city gates, 20 feet wide (about 6.1 meters) and 10 feet high (about 3 meters), which can be controlled by the red plastic buttons inside the fortress to fall or rise. The gates of some fortresses are closed from inside and cannot be accessed. The entrance and exit of the fortress are connected to other areas within Level 283, such as a sea ball pool, rest area, maze, or pipeline. Sliding through the exit slide of the pipeline seems to be the only way to enter the closed fortress.</p>
    <p>M.E.G.'s Epsilon base is located within the fortress and can provide shelter for homeless people, as well as food and almond water. There is a reliable exit inside the base, leading to Level 0.</p>
    <h3 style="color:red;">Bases, outposts, and communities</h3>
    <h4>M. E.G. (Explorer General Office) Epsilon Base:</h4>
    <p>There are about 200 explorers stationed.</p>
    <p>Located near one of the exits leading to Level 0.</p>
    <p>Friendly.</p>
    <p>Open trade.</p>
    <p>Located within the fortress.</p>
    <p>Armed forces.</p>
    <p>There is a stable passage between the "White Castle" and it (passing through the maze for 3 days).</p>
    <h3 style="color:red;">Entrance and Exit</h3>
    <h4>Entrance</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="horror-text">Warning:</span>
        <p>Find an unlocked door with a comically painted colorful exterior at Level 2, open it, and enter the maze of Level 283.</p>
        <p>A pipeline in a sports field can transport you from Level 9 to Level 283. Usually, such pipes must have white illuminated inner windows.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, a blue wheat pile appears within Level 10, and a clown scarecrow happens to be in the middle of this pile; Picking one of the wheat will be transported to Level 283.</p>
        <p>Entering a dilapidated, colorful, and rear seatless sedan at Level 22 allows for a direct entry into the rest area of Level 283. This path is very unusual, you need some luck to find this small car. If you are luckier, you can also attend a nearby party</p>
