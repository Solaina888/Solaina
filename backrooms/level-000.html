    <p>
      <span class="horror-text">Caution:</span> You have entered Level 0 of the Backrooms, a place of eerie stillness and decaying familiarity. The walls bear cracks and stains, and flickering fluorescent lights cast long shadows across the empty corridors.
    </p>

    <p>
      This level appears to mimic an ordinary office space, but something is undeniably wrong. The air is stagnant, carrying a faint scent of mold and decay. The low hum of flickering lights and distant murmurs echo through the abandoned rooms.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you navigate the labyrinthine corridors, it becomes increasingly difficult to discern direction or remember where you came from. Time seems to lose its meaning, and a growing sense of unease tugs at the edges of your consciousness.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="horror-text">Warning:</span> Be cautious as you explore Level 0. Though it may appear deceptively mundane, it harbors hidden dangers and unexplainable phenomena. The boundaries between reality and nightmare blur within these suffocating walls.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="horror-text">Entering Level 0:</span> To enter Level 0, one must venture through abandoned office buildings, forgotten malls, or desolate corridors. The exact method of entry remains shrouded in mystery, with some claiming to have accidentally stumbled into its haunted embrace.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="horror-text">Accessible Levels:</span> Level 0 can be accessed from <a href="level-001.html">Level 1</a> and certain rare instances from <a href="level-002.html">Level 2</a>. These connections serve as a gateway to the twisted depths of the Backrooms.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="horror-text">Navigating to Other Levels:</span> To proceed to higher levels or descend deeper into the abyss, one must search for hidden doorways, secret passages, or rifts in reality within Level 0. Beware, as each path holds its own set of terrors and mysteries.
